This week was awesome. I really liked learning about JQUERY, it is going to make JS a lot easier. I watched a Microsoft MVA about jump starting into JQUERY and it helped out a lot. The pair programming also helped me understand it better as well.
The layout of how to complete assignments was a little confusing, but I think I should have it down this next assignment.
